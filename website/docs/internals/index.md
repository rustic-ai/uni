## Implementation Overview

Uni's internals are organized into four major subsystems:

### Query Processing

1. **Parser** — Cypher syntax to AST (based on sqlparser)
2. **Planner** — Logical plan with optimization passes
3. **Executor** — Vectorized physical operators

### Runtime

1. **L0 Buffer** — In-memory SimpleGraph graph for mutations
2. **CSR Cache** — Compressed adjacency for O(1) traversal
3. **Property Manager** — Lazy loading from Lance

### Storage

1. **Lance Datasets** — Columnar storage with versioning
2. **WAL** — Write-ahead log for durability
3. **Indexes** — Vector (HNSW/IVF_PQ), scalar, hash

### Object Store

1. **object_store** crate for S3/GCS/Azure/local
2. **Local caching** for frequently accessed data
3. **Manifest files** for snapshot isolation

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Vectorized execution | 100-500x faster than row-at-a-time |
| Lance for storage | Native vector indexes + versioning |
| SimpleGraph for in-memory | Fast graph algorithms in Rust |
| Single-writer model | Simplicity over distributed complexity |

## Next Steps

Start with [Vectorized Execution](vectorized-execution.md) to understand how queries are processed.
