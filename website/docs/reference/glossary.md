# Glossary

A comprehensive glossary of terms used throughout the Uni documentation.

---

## A

### Adjacency Cache
An in-memory cache storing graph topology in Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format. Enables O(1) neighbor lookups for fast graph traversal. See [Vectorized Execution](../internals/vectorized-execution.md).

### Aggregation
A Cypher operation that combines multiple rows into summary values. Supported functions include `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and `COLLECT`. See [Cypher Querying](../guides/cypher-querying.md).

### ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor)
A class of algorithms that find vectors similar to a query vector without exhaustive comparison. Uni supports HNSW and IVF_PQ for ANN search. See [Vector Search](../guides/vector-search.md).

### Apache Arrow
A columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data. Uni uses Arrow internally for zero-copy data processing and SIMD-accelerated operations. See [Architecture](../concepts/architecture.md).

---

## B

### Batch
A group of rows processed together in vectorized execution. Typical batch sizes are 1024-8192 rows, chosen to fit in CPU cache. See [Vectorized Execution](../internals/vectorized-execution.md).

### B-Tree Index
A balanced tree data structure for ordered data. Used for range queries (`<`, `>`, `BETWEEN`). See [Indexing](../concepts/indexing.md).

---

## C

### Compaction
The process of merging multiple data files into fewer, larger files. In Uni, L1 runs are compacted into L2. See [Storage Engine](../internals/storage-engine.md).

### CSR (Compressed Sparse Row)
A compact representation of sparse matrices (graphs). Stores vertex neighbors in contiguous arrays with offset pointers. Used in the adjacency cache for efficient traversal.

### Cypher
A declarative graph query language using ASCII-art patterns. Originally developed for Neo4j, now standardized as OpenCypher. Uni implements a substantial subset. See [Cypher Querying](../guides/cypher-querying.md).

---

## D

### DataFusion
An Apache Arrow-native query engine. Uni uses DataFusion for columnar processing, aggregations, and some query operations.

### Direction
The orientation of an edge traversal:
- **Outgoing** (`-[r]->`)**: From source to target
- **Incoming** (`<-[r]-`): From target to source
- **Both** (`-[r]-`): Either direction

### Document Mode
A schema option (`is_document: true`) that enables flexible, semi-structured data storage. Vertices in document mode can have a `_doc` field containing arbitrary JSON.

---

## E

### Edge
A connection between two vertices in a graph. In Uni, edges have:
- **Type**: Category of relationship (e.g., `CITES`, `AUTHORED_BY`)
- **Direction**: From source to destination
- **Properties**: Optional key-value attributes

### EID (Edge ID)
A 64-bit identifier for edges. Encoded as `edge_type_id (16 bits) | local_offset (48 bits)`. See [Identity Model](../concepts/identity.md).

### Embedding
A dense vector representation of data (text, images, etc.) in a high-dimensional space. Similar items have embeddings close together. See [Vector Search](../guides/vector-search.md).

### EXPLAIN
A Cypher command prefix that shows the query plan without executing the query. Useful for understanding how queries will be processed.

---

## F

### FastEmbed
A Rust library for generating text embeddings locally. Uni integrates FastEmbed for on-device embedding generation without external API calls. See [Vector Search](../guides/vector-search.md).

### Flush
The process of writing in-memory data (L0) to persistent storage (L1). Triggered by size thresholds or explicit calls.

---

## G

### Graph Database
A database optimized for storing and querying connected data. Models data as vertices (nodes) and edges (relationships) rather than tables and rows.

### gryf
A Rust graph library providing in-memory graph structures and algorithms. Uni uses gryf for the L0 buffer and working graphs.

---

## H

### Hash Index
An index structure using hash tables for O(1) equality lookups. Best for exact match queries on high-cardinality columns.

### HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)
A graph-based algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search. Provides high recall and fast queries at the cost of memory. See [Indexing](../concepts/indexing.md).

---

## I

### IVF_PQ (Inverted File with Product Quantization)
A vector index that partitions vectors into clusters and compresses them. Lower memory than HNSW but typically lower recall.

---

## J

### JSONL (JSON Lines)
A text format with one JSON object per line. Uni's primary format for bulk data import.

---

## K

### KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
Finding the K vectors most similar to a query vector. Uni's vector search returns KNN results ordered by distance.

---

## L

### L0 Buffer
The in-memory write buffer that accepts all incoming mutations. Contains a gryf graph for topology and Arrow builders for properties. See [Storage Engine](../internals/storage-engine.md).

### L1 Layer
Immutable Lance datasets created by flushing L0. Contains sorted runs of data not yet compacted into L2.

### L2 Layer
The base storage layer containing fully compacted, indexed data. Most data resides here after compaction.

### Label
A type classifier for vertices (e.g., `Paper`, `Author`). Similar to a table name in relational databases. Encoded in the VID.

### Lance
A columnar data format optimized for ML workloads. Features native vector indexing, versioning, and cloud storage support. Uni uses Lance as its primary storage format. See [Storage Engine](../internals/storage-engine.md).

### Late Materialization
An optimization that delays loading heavy properties until after filtering. Reduces I/O by only loading data for rows that survive filters. See [Vectorized Execution](../internals/vectorized-execution.md).

### LSM Tree (Log-Structured Merge Tree)
A storage architecture with tiered levels (L0, L1, L2). Writes go to memory first, then flush to immutable files that are periodically compacted.

---

## M

### Manifest
A JSON file describing the state of storage at a point in time. Contains dataset versions, index metadata, and L1 run information. Enables snapshot isolation.

### MATCH
The primary Cypher clause for specifying graph patterns to find. Uses ASCII-art syntax like `(a)-[r]->(b)`.

### Morsel
A work unit in parallel execution. Source data is divided into morsels that workers process independently. See [Vectorized Execution](../internals/vectorized-execution.md).

---

## N

### Node
See [Vertex](#vertex).

---

## O

### OpenCypher
An open standard for the Cypher query language. Uni implements a substantial subset of OpenCypher.

---

## P

### Predicate Pushdown
An optimization that pushes filter conditions down to the storage layer. Reduces I/O by filtering at scan time rather than after loading. See [Query Planning](../internals/query-planning.md).

### Profile
A Cypher command prefix that executes the query and shows detailed timing for each operation. More informative than EXPLAIN.

### Property
A key-value attribute on a vertex or edge. Properties have defined types (String, Int32, Vector, etc.) in the schema.

### Property Graph
A data model where vertices and edges can have arbitrary properties. More flexible than simple labeled graphs.

---

## Q

### Query Plan
The sequence of operations that will execute a query. Includes logical plan (what to do) and physical plan (how to do it).

---

## R

### RecordBatch
An Apache Arrow data structure containing a batch of columnar data with a shared schema. The fundamental data unit in vectorized execution.

### Relationship
See [Edge](#edge).

---

## S

### Schema
The structure definition for a graph, including:
- Labels and their properties
- Edge types and constraints
- Vector dimensions
- Indexes

### Selection Vector
A bitmap or index array marking which rows in a batch are "active" after filtering. Avoids copying data when filtering.

### SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)
CPU instructions that operate on multiple data elements simultaneously. Arrow compute kernels use SIMD for fast filtering and arithmetic.

### Snapshot
A consistent point-in-time view of the database. Readers see a stable snapshot even as writes occur.

### Snapshot Isolation
A concurrency model where each reader sees a consistent snapshot. Readers don't block writers and vice versa.

---

## T

### Tombstone
A marker indicating deleted data. Soft deletes mark rows as deleted; compaction removes tombstoned data.

### Traversal
Following edges from vertices to discover connected vertices. A fundamental graph operation.

---

## U

### UNWIND
A Cypher clause that expands a list into multiple rows. Useful for batch operations and working with array properties.

---

## V

### Vector Index
A data structure enabling fast similarity search on high-dimensional vectors. Uni supports HNSW and IVF_PQ vector indexes.

### Vectorized Execution
A query processing model that operates on batches of rows rather than one row at a time. Improves performance through better cache utilization and SIMD operations. See [Vectorized Execution](../internals/vectorized-execution.md).

### Vertex
A node in the graph representing an entity. In Uni, vertices have:
- **VID**: Unique identifier
- **Label**: Type classification
- **Properties**: Key-value attributes

### VID (Vertex ID)
A 64-bit identifier for vertices. Encoded as `label_id (16 bits) | local_offset (48 bits)`. See [Identity Model](../concepts/identity.md).

---

## W

### WAL (Write-Ahead Log)
A durability mechanism that logs mutations before applying them. Enables recovery after crashes.

### UniId
A content-addressed identifier using SHA3-256 hash (32 bytes). Used for provenance tracking and distributed synchronization with CRDT systems. See [Identity Model](../concepts/identity.md).

### WITH
A Cypher clause that pipes results from one query part to another. Enables subquery-like behavior and intermediate aggregations.

### Working Graph
An in-memory graph materialized from storage for query execution. Backed by gryf.

---

## Y

### YIELD
A Cypher clause used with CALL to specify which columns to return from a procedure. Used with vector search and other built-in procedures.
